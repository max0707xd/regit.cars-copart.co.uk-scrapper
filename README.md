# REGIT.CARS + copart.co.uk http basic data scrapper python 3.8
 this tool is created for regit.cars to find a vehicle plate number, knowing only some part of it (useful for copart.co.uk as they are hiding last 3 characters ).

This tool is made for scrapping data from page of your choice and saving it's cource code on your computer.
I've had a problem with regit.cars, when i knew only first 4 characters of registration plate, and had to find all other possibilities from aaa to zzz which is 26^3 combinations.

It compares html title of the regit.cars/car page with the title of unexisting vehicle and saves the registration plate and vehicle name, so you can easily reduce the span of searches to specific make and model.  (idea  -  add fuel type and color ? )

Feel free to add suggestions.
